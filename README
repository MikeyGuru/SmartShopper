Smart Shopper V1.00
Android Native App built in Titanium

Allows you to scan barcodes to create a shopping list


Smart Shopper is a useful and simple way of making out
a shopping list on your phone. With Smart Shopper, your
shopping list stays with you everywhere you go and you’ll
have it on-hand once you’re ready to go to the store. Add
products by scanning the barcode so you know
exactly what to buy. Information about that product
automatically gets added to your list or you can enter it
yourself creating your own local database of products you
like to buy. In store, just open your list and clear off every
item you bought, or scan the barcode to remove it from
the list so you know you’re getting the right product. Items
are saved in your history for quickly adding them the next
time you need them. You can even share your list with your
relatives and friends via text message and email. Smart
Shopper is an Android native app.
